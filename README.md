# Rules For Myself
- No AI-generated code whatsoever
  - I will code everything by myself to really take in the different concepts, syntax, and logic
- I will read docs instead of asking AI
- I will only use AI for code review and ask it for explanation if I did anything wrong (or right)
- Commit frequently
